Luffy was born in Foosha Village in East Blue. When he was seven years old, he met and befriended a crew of pirates led by a captain named Red Haired Shanks. Luffy was inspired to become a pirate by Shanks and his crew. He once stabbed himself with a knife under his left eye to prove himself to Shanks so that he could join them in their adventures. However, later, Shanks refused to bring Luffy, stating that he was still too young to join Shanks' crew.

During a scene with Shanks and Higuma, a local mountain bandit that insulted Shanks and his crew, Luffy accidentally ate a Devil Fruit known as the Gomu Gomu no Mi and unwittingly turned himself into a rubber human. Initially, this situation affected Luffy badly as it means he will never be able to swim again, which is a great weakness to anyone who wishes to journey the seas. This, however, does not deter Luffy's dream and he continued aspiring to become a pirate.

Later, Luffy stood up to Higuma on behalf of Shanks. However, he was easily defeated and became a hostage. His captors were easily defeated by the Red-Haired Pirates, but the bandit leader Higuma has fled out to sea with Luffy.

Shanks Saves Luffy

While out at sea, Higuma threw Luffy in the ocean, only to be attacked by a sea king. Moments later while he was laughing at Luffy, Higuma was eaten. Though Shanks manages to save Luffy, he paid a high price: his left arm was lost to the sea king.

Shortly after, Shanks set sail along with his crew, but before leaving, he and Luffy promised each other that one day Luffy will surpass Shanks and become the Pirate King. Shanks then leaves Luffy his straw hat as a parting gift, telling him to return it once he surpasses him.

Meeting Portgas D. AceEdit
Luffy's New Family: Bandits and BrothersEdit
Sometime later, Monkey D. Garp took Luffy into the care of Curly Dadan, which was the first time Luffy meets Portgas D. Ace. Garp took him to Dadan, while Luffy refused. Garp picked him up, knocked on the door and put him down. He then got spit on by the newly arrived Ace, and the two angrily glare at each other.

Thinking back about the recent incident with Higuma, he told Dadan and the rest of the bandits that he hates bandits. Dadan bitterly scolded him for saying something like that, telling him he can stay at their hideout or starve to death. Luffy took a look at the meat-eating Ace, asking if he can have a piece. He then got scolded by Dadan, telling him he can do fine with just rice and water, but he saw Ace leave and followed him. Luffy said to Ace that he was not angry at Ace for spitting on him (since it was not something to get worked up about, and he is also thinking about Shank's behavior) and wanted to be friends. Ace responded by knocking a tree down at Luffy. Luffy then followed Ace across a bridge. Ace noticed him and knocked him off of the bridge. Luffy returned to Dadan's house a week later and told Dadan that he was being chased by wolves and fell off a cliff. Luffy got sent to bed without any treatment for his wounds. The next day, Ace went out again and Luffy followed, wanting to start a friendship, only to get shunned by Ace. After three months of persistently trying to follow Ace, Luffy eventually came across the Gray Terminal. Luffy overheard Ace and Sabo's conversation about buying a pirate ship. Luffy showed up to them and said that he wanted to be a pirate too. Ace and Sabo then tied Luffy to a tree and decided that they should kill Luffy to keep their secret safe. While Luffy panicked, Ace and Sabo have a hard time deciding who should kill Luffy since both Ace and Sabo have never killed anyone before. They heard someone coming and they untied Luffy and hid in the bushes. Porchemy of the Bluejam Pirates arrived searching for stolen money. Luffy then wandered off and got caught by Porchemy. Luffy yelled out Ace's name. Porchemy, recognizing that name, took Luffy away for interrogation.

Porchemy then dragged Luffy into a small house and tied him up. Luffy stated that he was not going to say anything. Porchemy then hit Luffy with a giant hammer, and discovered Luffy's Devil Fruit powers that prevent him from getting harmed by the hammer. Porchemy then used spiked gloves that are effective against Luffy. However, Luffy refused to yield. Porchemy lost his patience, drew a sword and was about to kill Luffy when Ace and Sabo arrived. They cut Luffy loose and defeated Porchemy. Out in the woods, Ace asked Luffy why he did not tell Porchemy about the whereabouts of Ace and Sabo's treasure. Luffy then told Ace that he wanted a friend, that he had no parents who can take care of him, and most importantly, that he did not want to be alone. After that, Ace and Sabo started to trust Luffy and he joined the two and the trio started making a name for themselves.

Ace, Sabo, and Luffy Sworn Brothers

Later on, Luffy was shown fighting Ace with the former losing (for the 50th time). After that, along with Sabo, they went to hunt gators, look for trash in the Gray Terminal, and eat and run. However, while they were running from the restaurant, they saw a man that called out Sabo's name. After they escape, Ace and Luffy started questioning him by choking him and forcing him to tell them who the man was. Sabo said that the man who called out to him was his dad, a noble. He told Ace and Luffy that at the time when he was a noble, even though he had parents, he was still lonely. He later joined Ace and Luffy when they shout out their dreams, and said that he wanted to draw a map of the world. However, the trio soon realized that they could not agree to be subordinates of the brother who might become captain on their pirate ship. Ace came up with an idea, telling Luffy and Sabo that they all could become brothers by exchanging sake that he stole from Dadan. As long as they have this bond, it will not matter where they are.

The Sabo IncidentEdit
One day, the Bluejam pirates captured the trio, and Bluejam told the trio that Sabo's father hired Captain Bluejam to get rid of Ace and Luffy and bring Sabo back to him. Sabo pleaded with his father to stop hurting his brothers. He said that he will do whatever his father commanded him to do if they stop hurting Ace and Luffy. Ace and Luffy protested, but his father agreed to the deal and ordered Sabo to come home. Sabo agreed to the deal. As he walked away, Ace and Luffy begged him to stay. As Sabo walked away with his father, tears were running down his face.

Luffy and Ace were carried away by the pirates, and they agreed to a deal that the Bluejam Pirates will let them go if they carried cargo to a marked location in Gray Terminal. Later, Bluejam revealed to Luffy and Ace that the cargo that they had carried was oil and gunpowder and that the Gray Terminal will be engulfed with flames. Luffy and Ace reacted angrily but were quickly apprehended by the pirates. Bluejam then informed them that all of them- the brother and the pirates- will die and that the nobles tricked them. They lost their sanity, and Bluejam asked Ace where the brother's treasure was stored. Later that night, the flames started and Luffy and Ace managed to cut themselves loose after being tied up. Luffy and Ace then ran for their lives.

While trying to escape, the two ran into Bluejam once more. Bluejam decided that if he was to die, that he will take the two with him; however, he first asked Ace one last time to reveal the location of their treasure. While Luffy was against it, Ace was willing to let the pirates have the treasure to ensure Luffy's safety. However, after Ace told Bluejam where the treasure was, Bluejam had his crew restrain Ace and Luffy. As Bluejam began to badmouth Sabo, Ace verbally retaliated, spurring Luffy to bite his captor's arm. The pirate responded by slashing him across the face with his sword; before the pirate could finish Luffy off, though, Ace let out a scream of rage, unbeknown to everyone there (including himself) that he was wielding Haki. The blast knocked everyone out, aside from Luffy and Bluejam. Bluejam almost killed Ace, but then Dadan appeared to rescue the two boys. Although she said that they should all run away, Ace refused to run from his enemy. Luffy decided to stay and fight as well, but Dadan forbid of it, remaining in his place. Luffy was then taken back by the bandits to recover at home.

Luffy awoke the next day, crying and saying that he wanted to know if Ace, Dadan, and Sabo were all right. After Dogura went to check the remaining ashes of Gray Terminal, Luffy was very upset for not being allowed to go look for Ace and Dadan. Suddenly, Ace arrived carrying Dadan on his back, Luffy jumped over to Ace, crying in relief for Ace being alive. He said that Luffy should not worry about him being dead, because he won't die, hitting Luffy on his head. Ace told how he and Dadan got out of the burning Terminal after beating Bluejam, and Dadan rested while getting healed with the medicines Ace stole from the town. Later that day, while outside playing with two beetles, Luffy saw Dogura coming back from the forest, and told him that Dadan and Ace were already home. Dogura then told them that while looking for Ace and Dadan, he went to the city, and saw Sabo setting sail on a boat, and then get shot by a ship. Ace attacked Dogura, accusing him for lying, but he replied he's not lying, nor dreaming, and he saw it with his own eyes. Luffy realized that Sabo was not happy at all for coming back to the city, and started to cry, Ace tried to go to the city to avenge him, but was stopped by Dadan, because she was afraid of Ace being killed, blaming the country for killing Sabo, not only the nobles. Since Ace was still too angry, he was tied up to a tree, while Luffy cried the whole night.[14]

Gomu Gomu no Pistol

A while later, Luffy, still mourning Sabo, asked Ace to never die, to which Ace made the promise to Luffy that he will not leave his "crybaby brother" alone. Luffy then decided that he wanted to be much stronger. After years of training, stealing food from the royal town and growing with Ace, Luffy witnessed Ace's departure at seventeen when he himself was fourteen.

Waiting three more years, Luffy decided to train some more, finally mastering his Gomu Gomu no Pistol and other various attacks. Ready to depart when he turns seventeen, he thanked Dadan and the bandits, then waved goodbye to the rest of the village, saying he was the third, after Sabo and Ace, to depart.
