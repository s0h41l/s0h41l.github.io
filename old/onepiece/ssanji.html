Sanji was born in North Blue into the Vinsmoke Family, the reigning royal family of the Germa Kingdom. While he and his three brothers were all born on the same day, Sanji was born third, thereby making him the Kingdom's third prince.

While his mother was still alive, Sanji once prepared a meal for her. Even though the meal was ruined while Sanji was delivering it to her in some hospital, it made her smile and she decided that she would only eat what he had made for her, sparking an interest in cooking for Sanji.

Sanji&#039;s Childhood Trauma
Sanji being bullied by his brothers.
Sanji's father, Vinsmoke Judge, revealed to his children at a young age that he had endowed their bodies with genetic enhancements, giving them the potential to develop superhuman abilities. He further revealed his ambition for Sanji and his four siblings to lead their kingdom's military arm, Germa 66, in the future, and began training them to capitalize on their genetic potential. While Sanji's siblings excelled at their exercises and their bodies evolved, Sanji continually lagged behind due to his body remaining human. This made him an easy target for his brothers, who bullied him regularly, and Judge did not intervene due to his disdain for Sanji's weakness.One day, Judge caught him serving food to a rat in his room and shouted that Sanji would need to stop cooking and train even harder if he wanted to catch up with his siblings. He then threw the food and the rat out of the palace, causing Sanji to cry. Sanji continued to be beaten up by his brothers regularly, with Reiju occasionally tending to his injuries.

Eventually, Judge became convinced that Sanji would never develop superhuman abilities and decided to erase his son's existence from his future plans by putting an iron mask on him and locking him in a Vinsmoke castle dungeon. At the same time, he staged a state funeral for his son, informing the onlooking Germa 66 soldiers that Sanji had died in a tragic accident.

Reiju Helps Sanji Escape

During the next six months of Sanji's imprisonment, his mask was only removed when receiving meals from the guards. At some point, he read about the All Blue from a cookbook he received. His brothers eventually discovered he was still alive and occasionally visited the dungeon just to continue bullying him. Reiju came to the dungeon to treat her brother's wounds but told him that she was not on his side. After the Germa Kingdom crossed the Red Line into the East Blue, Sanji declared to Reiju that he wanted to run away and become a chef. Reiju broke open Sanji's cell, allowing him to escape. As Sanji was fleeing, he ran into his father. Judge decided to allow Sanji to go on the condition that he never tell anyone about their relationship. While Germa 66 was attacking the island of Cozia in the East Blue, Reiju directed him to a cruise ship called the Orbit and told him to never come back to the Germa Kingdom. Having escaped the kingdom, Sanji cut all ties with his family and renounced his title as a prince.

The Dream of Two FoolsEdit
Two years after he left the Vinsmoke Family, a ten year-old Sanji was working as a ship's cook on the Orbit. One day, "Red Leg" Zeff, a pirate, and his crew, attacked the ship. However, both ships were caught in a sudden storm and sank. Zeff managed to save the young Sanji from drowning, losing part of his leg in the process, and the two were washed onto a rock outcropping, high above the sea; before the storm tore the boats apart, Sanji had cried out his dream to find the All Blue, which was why he was saved by Zeff after.

Sanji Discovers Zeff&#039;s Missing Leg
Sanji realizing that Zeff has sacrificed his leg for him.
Despite their good fortune, there was little food for them: a few rations had washed onto the rock with them, but there was no vegetation, no animals, and no way to reach the water to fish. Splitting up what little rations remained, Zeff ordered Sanji to sit at the other end of the island to look for a ship. Sanji protested that Zeff was keeping a large sack for himself, but Zeff brushed him off, saying that as an adult, his stomach was bigger.Days passed, Sanji had no more food, but there was still no sign of a ship. Many weeks afterward (the exact amount of time differs between the manga and anime), an emaciated Sanji decided to take a chance and kill Zeff for his food. He did not kill the old man, however: when he slashed open the old man's sack in a fit of rage, he discovered that there was no food inside, only treasure. To his horror, he realized that Zeff had eaten his own leg to save Sanji.

Zeff confessed that he often lacked food on the high seas and planned on opening a restaurant on the seas. Sanji, guilty over plotting to kill Zeff, agreed, but Zeff remarked that he was too weak to help. Soon after, a ship appeared, and they were spared from death. Because of this ordeal, Sanji pledged to never refuse food to a starving individual, no matter how evil or poor they may be. In the manga, Sanji began smoking shortly after starting to work at the Baratie in order to impress Zeff, despite Zeff's warnings that it would destroy his taste buds, only for Sanji to reply "Now, I am a man!".
