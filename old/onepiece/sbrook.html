Before Brook joined the Rumbar Pirates, Brook was the leader of a battle convoy in a "certain kingdom", where he learned his fencing and many of his attacks received their names. These nicknames of his fencing style were given to him by his previous crew, and nothing else has been spoken of his past, before he joined the Rumbar Pirates.
<br>
<b>Meeting and Leaving LaboonEdit</b>
<br>
Fifty-two years ago, Brook used to be part of Yorki's pirate crew, the Rumbar Pirates, as one of the many musicians that comprised most of the crew. While he and the rest of the crew were still in the West Blue, their ship was one day followed by a baby whale who had gotten lost. Seeing that the whale was really upset, Brook suggested to his captain that they should play some music to cheer the whale up. Together with the rest of the crew, Brook played a beautiful song that worked.
<br>
<b>Brook Watching over Laboon</b>
<br>

The next day, Brook and the rest of the crew discovered that the whale had continued following them. Despite this, Brook and the rest of the crew allowed the whale to follow them and even gave the whale a name, Laboon. Since then, Brook and the rest of the crew went around adventuring with Laboon tagging along. Together they went through a lot all the while singing joyful songs together. As they journeyed together with Laboon, many of Brook's crew mates noticed that he was the one that Laboon was closest to.
<br>
When Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates were about to enter the Grand Line, they suddenly faced a dilemma then. Since Laboon was still a baby, they feared that the Grand Line was too dangerous place for such a young whale. The rest of the Rumbar Pirates tried to convince Laboon to stay in the West Blue but failed, so Brook was asked to tell Laboon to stay personally. Brook tried to convince Laboon but likewise failed. Unable to do anything else, Brook and the other Rumbar Pirates tried to ignore Laboon in hopes that the whale would be dissuaded from following them and leave. Their plan seemingly worked and Laboon was not sighted for some time.
<br>
<b>Rumbar Pirates and Laboon Party</b>
<br>

However when Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates entered the Grand Line, they were surprised that Laboon had followed them into the Grand Line through the Reverse Mountain. Seeing that their ship had some repairs to be made anyway, Brook and the rest of the crew continued to sing along with the whale while their ship was being fixed.
<br>
After three months of fixing their ship, Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates decided to leave Laboon under the care of Crocus. They promised Laboon then that they would come back for the whale after going around the world. By then Laboon would've become very big and thus they also promised to take Laboon along with them on their adventures.
<br>
<b>The Death of the Rumbar Pirates and Brook's New Life</b>
<br>
<b>Rumbar Pirates Gather Around Yorkie</b>
<br>
Brook and the uninfected members gathering around their dying captain.
As Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates traveled across the Grand Line, they experienced all the challenges the sea had to offer. Despite the difficulties, they simply sang along while continuing to sail on. However, disaster struck the crew one day. The captain of the Rumbar Pirates, Yorki, and several others had caught an incurable disease while disembarking at a forest. To keep the disease from spreading to the rest of the crew who weren't infected, Yorki decided to take himself and the infected on the Rumbar Pirates' first ship and try to escape the Grand Line by going through the Calm Belt.
<br>
<b>Yorki told Brook and the remaining Rumbar</b> Pirates of his decision and how he regretted it as it was the only way to save the uninfected. Seeing as he could not return back to Laboon, Yorki asked Brook and the rest of the crew to give his regards to the whale. As Yorki lay dying on his deathbed, Yorki then asked Brook to send him and the infected off with his favorite song, Binks' Sake. With that, Brook and the remaining Rumbar Pirates were split from Yorki and those who were infected.

<br>
Despite losing half of the crew, Brook and the remaining Rumbar Pirates continued sailing through the Grand Line on a new ship. He was appointed to be their new captain and as they traveled through the sea, Brook gained a bounty for himself. Things went smoothly for Brook and the remaining Rumbar Pirates at first, however upon entering the Florian Triangle, Brook and his remaining crewmates were attacked by some enemy pirates. Brook and some of his crewmates were able to barely survive the assault. However, since the enemy had tainted their weapons with poison and that the Rumbar Pirate's doctor was killed in the attack, Brook and the survivors were slowly wasting away. Knowing that he had eaten the Yomi Yomi no Mi, Brook suggested one last thing to his crewmates.
<br>
He suggested to them that they should play one last song that would be recorded on a Tone Dial that they had previously bought from a merchant. Since he would be revived after death, Brook promised his crewmates that he would take this Dial and play it for Laboon to hear. Overjoyed with Brook's proposal, the remaining Rumbar Pirates mustered what little strength they had and started singing their favorite song one last time. Though joyful at recording their song, the remaining Rumbar Pirates slowly succumbed to the poison and died one after another. They each fell with smiles on their faces until only Brook was left. With a heavy heart and remembering the promise he made to Laboon, Brook continued playing all alone until he finally succumbed to the poison and died.
<br>
Brook&#039;s Soul Finding His Body
Brook's spirit finds his decayed body.
Despite some doubts, Brook's soul was able to return to the mortal world thanks to the powers of his Devil Fruit. Unfortunately for him, he had lost his body because of the fog in the area (it made it hard to find the ship) and had to search for it for one year. When he finally found his body, it was just a pile of bones. Only his afro remained intact because it "had strong roots". Upon rising back from the dead, Brook gathered up the skeletal remains of his dead crewmates and stored them all in coffins located deep within the ship.
<br>
For the next few uneventful decades, due to the ship's rudder having been broken in the battle, Brook stayed aboard all alone on the ship, left to the whims of the ocean's currents. With nothing much to do, Brook merely did as much as he could, such as rolling on the deck, jumping around, leaning against a wall at a 45 degree angle, and singing alone. When he slept, he would dream that he and his crew mates were still alive, and he would always wake up to find a lonely and cruel reality waiting for him. The fifty years Brook spent stranded on the ship were very harsh and painful, and he deeply missed the company of others.
<br>
A Dead Man Comes to the Island of the DeadEdit
After some time, Brook's ship drifted to Thriller Bark five years prior to the start of the series. Wanting to fix the rudder, he disembarked and explored the island. All he found, however, was the various creatures that inhabited there. He was then captured, saw how Gekko Moriah was able to create zombies and his shadow got stolen.
<br>
After being set adrift on his ship, Brook retraced his path and went back to the island. There he learned of the zombies' weakness while spying on some. He, however, believed it to be fish, leading Hogback to accidentally correct him that it was the sea salt on the fish. He interrogated Hogback for where his zombie counterpart was.
<br>
Brook Crawls Away From Ryuma
Brook shamefully crawling after defeat.
After dispatching some zombies, Brook found his zombie counterpart, Ryuma. However during the battle, Ryuma proved too strong for Brook. After receiving some severe blows to his skull, Brook asked for mercy from Ryuma and quietly ran away from Thriller Bark. The battle left Brook with a crack in his skull. For the next five years since then, Brook had been training himself in order to beat Ryuma the next time they would meet
